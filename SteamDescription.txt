[h1]Empire at War Expanded: Deep Core[/h1]
[h2]This is a modding resource and not intended to be played by itself![/h2]

[h2]About this mod[/h2]

This is a standalone version of DeepCore, the Lua framework that powers most of the mechanics found in Empire at War Expanded.
It is not intended to played by itself, but rather to allow other projects to use the DeepCore framework in sub mods without having to install it into their mods directly.
[b]This mod does not include the mechanics from Empire at War Expanded. It only provides the framework these mechanics are based upon.[/b]

[h2]Capabilities of DeepCore[/h2]

DeepCore is primarily designed as a framework that allows the definition of plugins that get loaded and updated at specified times automatically.
This allows for fast implementation of new mechanics without having to modify existing code.
DeepCore also includes an alternative implementation to PGStateMachine with a focus on transitions between states. 
States can be setup using a specifically implemented internal domain specific language.
Last but not least, DeepCore also provides the crossplot library which allows for communication between isolated Lua scripts via means of GlobalValues using a publish-subscribe pattern.
